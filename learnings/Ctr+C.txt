Ctr+C without Any implementation stops server on Linux System Due to SIGINT sending signal to running process

<-----NOTE----->
It does not close opened resourses like sockets , opened files,etc


<-----IMPORTANT----->
For a production ready environment we have to Catch the SIGINT signal using a custom signal handler 
Inside Handler :
    1. Log "Server shutting down" or similar.
    2. Close listening socket (close(server_socket)).
    3. Free memory or resources (if needed).
    4. Gracefully exit.
